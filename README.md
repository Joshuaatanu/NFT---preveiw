### What I learned

I leanrt how to use the grid class on bootstrap and margin  to cecnter div

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
@media only  screen and (max-width: 769px){
    body{
        padding-top:50px;
        padding:25px;
    }
    .container{
        margin-top:25px;
    }
}
```
```
  javascript
  const isDarkSheme = window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme:dark)').matches;
if(isDarkSheme){
    console.log("Dark interface preferred")
}
```
### Continued development
I would like to learn how to use core css  rather than bootstrap
